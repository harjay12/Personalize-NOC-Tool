This is a tool I created to provide easy logging access to the current company's logging pages.

I am currently working as a NOC rep level I, and when first introduced to the job, I had to mark my presence in a couple of different places.

I first needed to clock in to the company time managed sheet, to the Call system we used, and to a manager's Google sheet created but management.

Knowing myself, I know I would miss some of these signs in so I came up with the idea to create one tool I would just need to sign in from that tool, and I would sign myself in any other places I needed to be in, and when signed out.

I decided to use Python to develop he tool; however, with the Python script, I am using AutoHotkey64.exe to interact with the computer keyboard and screen.
I am not familiar with the AutoHotkey64.exe script. Please learn how it works before using the script from this code.
